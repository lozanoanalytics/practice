1. What is the code number that I e-mailed to you? 6a32cd9d8
2. What e-mail address are you using for this course? ivan.lozano001@umb.edu
3. Which IDE did you decide to use for this class? I will be using Visual Studio Code for this class.
4. Tell me a bit about the process of carrying out these tasks. What went well? What was challenging?
Is there anything else you want to tell me -- or have questions about?
The process of carrying out these tasks went pretty well, although I had to contact IT
to help in resetting my password. Not sure what went on there. Installing Python
was fairly simple and it was pretty cool to learn the functionality in sublime text which I was unfamiliar with.
I have yet to learn all the linux commands, which I am excited to unlock the full potential of it.
Looking forward to learning more using linux, as a I am building my own PC, and want to fully use it with ubunto.
Are there any books you recommend for web programming? I would love to learn how to make my own interactive
website using python. Thanks -Ivan
