    Purpose: Homework 4: Reflection"""

1. How did the process of creating these programs go for you? This homework was by far the most
challenging thus far. After several attempts, and discussing in class about the truth tables, I
thought I grasped the concept, but the application was a different animal because of the
idiosyncrasies of Python itself.
2. What were your main challenges and how did you overcome them? The first challenge was trying
to figure how the Boolean operators and how they worked with each other in different cases. While
it was clear to me on how to convert input functions to integers automatically, doing so for
Boolean operators were not the same as bool ("False") printed as “True” due to input as a non-
empty string. The second issue was figuring out when to use the ‘not’ operator in the if/else
clauses. I wouldn't have figured it out without the extra online resources posted on the homework
webpage which were very useful.
3. What did you learn that may be of use as you move along in this class? I learned to be careful
when using the Boolean commands, and always test my code to make sure the syntax is correct. I
learned to be open to helpful resources and ask specific questions when my code is failing
after several attempts. I also learned that indentation when stringing more combined functions
is important for your code to run smoothly.
