1. How did the process of creating these programs go for you?
The process for creating this program was quite challenging as I initially thought of
of this assignment as a while loop having multiple entries for the user to select from,
but after careful thought I realized that there is a predetermined list of only 12
options to select from and thus it would be easier for the program to cycle through the
12 options.
2. What were your main challenges and how did you overcome them?
I think my main challenges in writing this program was getting code to actually run after
the first if clause. I realized that another nested loop would be best, but it was challenging
because the list that I created for the twelve options calling the tuple ordering was ascending,
but could also be called in a descending order. Using multiple options in the for loops was the
key to effectively running the program with as few lines of code as possible.
3. What did you learn that may be of use as you move along in this class?
I learned how to combine the power of if/else clauses with for loops to have a program write out
a range of inputted values. I also learned the use of calling the end of a tuple quickly without
having to count the position of a value. It was interesting to be able to call multiple entries
in the for loop.
