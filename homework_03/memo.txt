    Purpose   :       Explaining how the process of hw3 went
'''
1. How did the process of creating these programs go for you?
The process went well for the most part, this homework was  harder that the last as it
tested us more on string concatenation. I feel that I could use more help on python base math
expressions.
2. What were your main challenges and how did you overcome them?
The main challenges I encountered was using the math package to calculate radius and wrapping
the right parenthesis for the interest equation. I thought I should have been able to use
python's expressions as well, but I could not figure it out. I thought the math module was
interesting to work with.
3. What did you learn that may be of use as you move along in this class?
I learned that organization matters a lot in coding, if you try to write everything
all just in one line it may be hard to read and follow. I learned that taking equations,
and breaking them down one piece at a time is a good way to get to the correct answer
and making sure your code is running flawlessly. I also learned that the way that using
expressions we can transform numbers to how they are represented, for example the percentages
