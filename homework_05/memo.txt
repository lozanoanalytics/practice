#### Purpose: Reflection to the questions

1. How did the process of creating these programs go for you?
This homework was a bit confusing in the beginning because I was unsure of how
I would create statements to the user without writing distinct print statements.
The structure of the if/else and elif clauses were familiar and although it
was a bit challenging to conceptualize by the end I thought this homework was a bit
easier than the last one.
2. What were your main challenges and how did you overcome them?
The main challenges was trying to understand what the user will see when they input
whether they have completed their school assignment or not. To overcome this confusion,
I thought about the structure of the questions as boolean statements, in which the
output would be True (valid) if a yes was entered as a response. For anything else it
would divert to a false entry and thus the negative input of not completing the school
assignment would be the result.
3. What did you learn that may be of use as you move along in this class?
As I move along the class I see that the elif function is a much shorter way to write code
to indicate the program to go on to the next step. Also, instead of writing explicitly
what you are looking other options, the else clause was more efficient to be all-inclusive
of other entries the user might enter.
