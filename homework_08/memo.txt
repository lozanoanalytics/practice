1. How did the process of creating these programs go for you?

This assignment was fairly challenging when it came to linking
dictionaries and lists. I thought it was interesting how many
nested statements there was considering it was all wrapped in one
larger outer while loop.

2. What were your main challenges and how did you overcome them?

The main challenges that I ran into was first getting started. This was
difficult because of the first initial for loop in step 2 would have to
link the list and index number of each of the books that was stored in the
dictionary. After each step I would attempt a series of trial and error
to get it right. The other challenging portion was part 4, to get
the dictionary to print out in the format it was supposed to be in.
I realized later on that there was multiple ways of doing it which one
included a for loop.

3. What did you learn that may be of use as you move along in this class?

I learned how to use dictionaries to store data as well as combine them
with for loops to call out all the keys at once while keeping their format.
Writing shorter code, and being consistent with my indentation will be
important for my success in this class while paying closing attention to
detail.
