    Purpose: Homework 6: Practicing For and While loops,
    and time modules"""

1. How did the process of creating these programs go for you?
The process in creating this program at first was quite difficult since there appeared to
be a lot of moving parts. At first, I was confused since we had to include variables that were
declared prior to the loops had to be in the loops as well.

2. What were your main challenges and how did you overcome them?
Being able to understand how loops work without having the program crash was at first
worrisome since the idea of a loop is to continue looping through the program at
at an almost infinite amount of times. So, at first my program was not running.
I also thought making sure I was following the structure of including declared
variables in my my while loop.

3. What did you learn that may be of use as you move along in this class?
The loops in this program replace several steps when writing print statements
repeatedly. I thought that by practicing the difference between the While
loop as well I understood more of when to use it over for loops waiting for the
userâ€™s response. Also, anytime I want to practice with data I have the random module
to generate random integers.
