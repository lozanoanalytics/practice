1. How did the process of creating these programs go for you?
The process went well for the most part, I had some challenges in making sure all
the pieces to the puzzle fit right. As I went along some of the steps got easier
as I got more comfortable with typing in code. There are a lot of neat tricks that
can make the process go smoother.

2. What were your main challenges and how did you overcome them?
The main challenges that I had was making sure the alignment was just right.
I made mistakes at first because I was using the space key. The trick that I found to
align the written lines just right is using the tab key.

3. What did you learn that may be of use as you move along in this class?
I learned that copy and pasting the print command multiple times can lower the amount
of time and typing you must perform during each exercise. Also, in aligning the code it
is sometimes helpful to use the beginning and end of each line as guides.
